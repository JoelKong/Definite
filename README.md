## Application Code
Made using python with the use of a currency converter API and also Web3 in Remix IDE API. Source code is for the back end. Also made use of Figma for the prototype.

## Use Case (TLDR)
Users can choose to stake Definite tokens in exchange for money for a period of time. After reaching the maturity date, users will get back their money that they staked and an additional interest based off their saver point rank. These ranks can be progressed the more the user stakes their tokens with us which gives higher interest rates for returns the higher the rank as well as bonus saver points. These saver points can be used in exchange for rewards in our shop such as vouchers, cosmetics, avatar or even app UI decoration. Users can also create a joint account group with their friends where people can contribute their tokens towards a goal in mind. Inside the group, there is also a chat function as well as the latest token transactions to the group.

## Buy Tokens
Users can buy Definite tokens from us using real currency and we will safekeep their money until the duration of their stake ends. The longer they stake their tokens, the higher the interest rates of their return along with a bonus based off their current saver rank.

## User Tokens
Users can also view all their current and completed stakes via the 'My Tokens' tab and viewing a specific stake would show even more details about that transaction and also allows users to prematurely end the stake to get their money back in case of an emergency.
